## POST /interactions
*this endpoint is used to create an interaction between two users, resulting in two rows that are bi-directional edges*

**Request**

| Headers       | Type         |
| ------------- | ------------ |
| Authorization | Bearer Token |


| Body       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| eventType  | eventType refers to the type of interaction that is being posted to the database. since rewriting the profiles service, quests and workshops have been deprecated. For our purposes, this should only be set to "CONNECTION" for now. |
| eventParam | eventParam is the generic argument to be passed for each event (typically an ID). For a connection, it will be the profile ID (not an email, a humanID) to form a connection with someone                                             |
*example request*
```json
{
    "eventType": "CONNECTION",
    "eventParam": "SixVansSort"
}
```
